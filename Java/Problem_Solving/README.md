# 🧠 Problem-Solving

This folder contains coding challenges and exercises aimed at strengthening algorithmic thinking, data structure mastery, and general problem-solving ability.

## 📌 Purpose

These exercises help improve:
- Algorithm design and optimization
- Understanding of core data structures (arrays, trees, graphs, etc.)
- Logical thinking and coding fluency
- Preparation for coding interviews (LeetCode-style)

While many of these problems are inspired by platforms like [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com), [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com), and [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com), the goal is broader:
> **To build core computational thinking that applies across software development.**

## 📂 Structure & Naming

Problems Are named: 
source-topic-name-difficulty 
example: leetcode-arrays-merge-sorted-array-easy

## 🔄 Review Strategy

To retain and deepen problem-solving patterns over time, I follow a **lightweight 3-phase review system** inspired by spaced repetition. It’s designed to be **sustainable**, **long-term**, and fits into my daily 40–50 minute LeetCode session.

### 🎯 Goals:
- Strengthen long-term recall of algorithms and techniques
- Build mental templates for common problem patterns
- Keep effort low while maximizing retention

### 🔁 Three-Phase Review Cycle

Each problem enters a review cycle based on my confidence after solving it:

| Phase     | When to Review           | Purpose                                              |
|-----------|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Phase 1   | 1 week after solving      | Reinforce early understanding                        |
| Phase 2   | 3–4 weeks after Phase 1  | Test mid-term memory and spot reusable patterns      |
| Phase 3   | 3 months after Phase 2   | Long-term check — revisit only if truly necessary    |

> Optional Phase 4 (6 months): For core patterns like sliding window, BFS/DFS, DP, etc.

### 🧠 Review Methods

Instead of re-solving every problem, I use light strategies based on recall:

- 🗣️ **Explain the solution aloud** or in writing  
- ✍️ **Sketch the core logic or approach**  
- 🧪 **Re-solve only if I forgot key ideas or made mistakes**

Each review ends with a confidence tag:
- `🔥 Easy Recall` → promote to long-term or drop from cycle
- `🤔 Partial Recall` → stay in current phase or repeat
- `❌ Forgotten` → back to Phase 1

### 🗓️ Weekly Routine

- **Mon/Wed/Fri**: New problems (30–40 min)
- **Tue/Thu**: Review older problems (40–50 min)
- **Weekend**: Optional open review or revisiting hard problems

I maintain a queue system where each problem gets rescheduled based on performance and confidence. 
This queue integrates into my overall topic-review workflow.
