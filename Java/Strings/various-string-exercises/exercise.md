## ChatGpt Solution Analysis

### Solution for Ex11

Here's a Java solution for exercise 11: Remove Duplicate Characters, using a Set to track characters and a StringBuilder to construct the result:

    import java.util.HashSet;
    import java.util.Set;

    public class RemoveDuplicates {

        public static String removeDuplicateChars(String input) {
            Set<Character> seen = new HashSet<>();
            StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();

            for (char ch : input.toCharArray()) {
                if (!seen.contains(ch)) {
                    seen.add(ch);
                    result.append(ch);
                }
            }

            return result.toString();
        }

        public static void main(String[] args) {
            String input = "programming";
            String output = removeDuplicateChars(input);
            System.out.println("Output: " + output);  // Output: progamin
        }
    }

üîç How it works:
Converts the input string to a char array.
Iterates over each character.
Adds each character to a Set if it hasn‚Äôt been seen before.
Appends unique characters to a StringBuilder.
Let me know if you want a version that preserves casing or handles Unicode/special characters more robustly.

### Analysis for Ex12

the following is a solution for exercise 12, analyze it for correctness and style and grade it from 1 to 10. provide a better and cleaner solution.

        private static String convertToTitleCase(String sentence) {
            String[] sentenceAsArray = sentence.split("\\W+");
            for (int i = 0; i < sentenceAsArray.length; i++) {
                sentenceAsArray[i] = sentenceAsArray[i].substring(0, 1).toUpperCase() + sentenceAsArray[i].substring(1, sentenceAsArray[i].length());
            }
            return String.join(" ", sentenceAsArray);
        }

        public static void main(String[] args) {
            System.out.println("\n-----Ex12: Convert String to Title Case\n");

            String input = "programming is fun";
            System.out.println("Input sentence: " + input);
            System.out.println("Input sentence in Title Case: " + convertToTitleCase(input));

            System.out.println("\n-----Ex12: Convert String to Title Case");
        }

    }

‚úÖ Analysis of the Provided Solution (Exercise 12: Convert to Title Case)

üìå Correctness
‚úÖ The method convertToTitleCase correctly:
Splits the sentence into words.
Capitalizes the first letter of each word.
Joins them back with spaces.
‚ö†Ô∏è Minor Bug: The split pattern \\W+ splits on non-word characters, which includes punctuation and might lead to incorrect behavior for some inputs.
For example, "hello-world" would be split into ["hello", "world"] instead of treating hello-world as a single word.
Also, it removes punctuation (like ,, .), which is probably not intended in a title-case conversion.

üßë‚Äçüé® Style & Readability
üëé Variable name sentenceAsArray is a bit awkward. Better names would be words or tokens.
üëé No input validation (e.g., null or empty string).
‚úÖ Output messages in main are clear and well-organized.
üëé The expression .substring(1, sentenceAsArray[i].length()) can just be .substring(1).

üìä Grade: 6.5/10
‚úîÔ∏è Correct in basic functionality.
‚ùó Could behave unexpectedly with punctuation or hyphenated words.
üßπ Can be cleaned up for style and robustness.

‚úÖ Improved and Cleaner Version

    public class Ex12 {

        public static String convertToTitleCase(String sentence) {
            if (sentence == null || sentence.isEmpty()) {
                return sentence;
            }

            String[] words = sentence.split(" ");
            StringBuilder titleCase = new StringBuilder();

            for (String word : words) {
                if (word.isEmpty()) continue; // handle multiple spaces
                titleCase.append(Character.toUpperCase(word.charAt(0)));
                if (word.length() > 1) {
                    titleCase.append(word.substring(1));
                }
                titleCase.append(" ");
            }

            return titleCase.toString().trim(); // remove trailing space
        }

        public static void main(String[] args) {
            System.out.println("\n----- Ex12: Convert String to Title Case -----");

            String input = "programming is fun";
            String output = convertToTitleCase(input);

            System.out.println("Input:  " + input);
            System.out.println("Output: " + output);

            System.out.println("----- End of Ex12 -----\n");
        }
    }

üß† Why This Version is Better
Uses " " (space) instead of \\W+ to preserve punctuation and treat only spaces as separators.
Uses Character.toUpperCase() instead of substringing the first letter.
Handles empty input and extra spaces.
Clean naming and structure.
Would you like a version that preserves punctuation and capitalizes only alphabetic words?


### Solution for Ex13

supply a solution for the following exercise:

ChatGPT said:
Here's a clean and efficient Java solution for Exercise 13: Find First Non-Repeating Character, using a HashMap<Character, Integer> to count character occurrences:

‚úÖ Solution

    import java.util.HashMap;
    import java.util.Map;

    public class Ex13 {

        public static Character findFirstNonRepeatingChar(String input) {
            if (input == null || input.isEmpty()) {
                return null; // or throw IllegalArgumentException depending on design choice
            }

            Map<Character, Integer> charCount = new HashMap<>();

            // First pass: Count occurrences
            for (char ch : input.toCharArray()) {
                charCount.put(ch, charCount.getOrDefault(ch, 0) + 1);
            }

            // Second pass: Find first character with count 1
            for (char ch : input.toCharArray()) {
                if (charCount.get(ch) == 1) {
                    return ch;
                }
            }

            return null; // no non-repeating character found
        }

        public static void main(String[] args) {
            System.out.println("\n----- Ex13: Find First Non-Repeating Character -----");

            String input = "swiss";
            Character result = findFirstNonRepeatingChar(input);

            System.out.println("Input: " + input);
            System.out.println("First non-repeating character: " + (result != null ? "'" + result + "'" : "None found"));

            System.out.println("----- End of Ex13 -----\n");
        }
    }

üß† Key Points
Time complexity: O(n)
Two linear passes through the string: one for counting, one for identifying.

Handles edge cases:
Returns null if input is null, empty, or all characters are repeating.
Case-sensitive ('S' and 's' are different).
Readable and idiomatic Java code with use of getOrDefault() for compact counting.
Let me know if you'd like a case-insensitive version or one that returns the index instead of the character.
