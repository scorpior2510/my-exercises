## ChatGpt Prompt
Can you generate a classic java oop exercise that meets the following criteria: 1. level of difficulty: 7/10 2. should take about 2.5 hours to complete

## Description

Objective
Design and implement a small Library Management System using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Java.

Requirements
You must implement the following entities using proper encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism:
1.	Book (Base class)
o	id (unique identifier, integer)
o	title (string)
o	author (string)
o	availableCopies (integer, represents the number of copies available)
o	borrow() method (reduces availableCopies by 1 if available, otherwise prints an error)
o	returnBook() method (increases availableCopies by 1)
2.	Member (Abstract Class)
o	memberId (integer)
o	name (string)
o	borrowedBooks (List of borrowed books)
o	borrowBook(Book book) (abstract method)
o	returnBook(Book book) (removes book from borrowed list and increases available copies)
3.	RegularMember (Subclass of Member)
o	Can borrow up to 3 books at a time
o	Implements borrowBook(Book book)
4.	PremiumMember (Subclass of Member)
o	Can borrow up to 5 books at a time
o	Implements borrowBook(Book book)
5.	Library (Manages book and member operations)
o	books (List of books available)
o	members (List of registered members)
o	addBook(Book book) (adds a book to the collection)
o	registerMember(Member member) (adds a member to the system)
o	borrowBook(int memberId, int bookId) (handles book borrowing)
o	returnBook(int memberId, int bookId) (handles book returning)

Implementation Details
â€¢	Use constructors to initialize objects.
â€¢	Use lists (ArrayList<Book>, ArrayList<Member>) to manage collections.
â€¢	Ensure that borrowBook() prevents exceeding the limit for members.
â€¢	Implement proper toString() methods for easy display of information.
â€¢	Write a test class (LibraryTest) with a main() method that: 
o	Creates a library
o	Adds books
o	Registers members
o	Simulates borrowing and returning books

Bonus (Optional)
â€¢	Add a Librarian class with methods to search for books by title or author.
â€¢	Implement an OverdueNotification feature using a simple HashMap<Member, List<Book>>.

Expected Outcome
By the end of this exercise, you should have a functioning Library Management System where members can borrow and return books while respecting borrowing limits. The implementation should demonstrate OOP principles like inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.
Would you like me to provide a starting template for the classes? ðŸš€
